    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>

                <h5>Step I</h5>
                <p>
                    Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry with paper towels. Heat oil in the pot of an electric pressure cooker <br>(such as Instant Pot®) on "Saute" mode; add chicken. Cook until browned, about 6 minutes per side. <br> Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving drippings in the pot.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Step II</h5>
                <p>
                    Place celery, onion, and mushrooms in the pot; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; <br> cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Place chicken back in the pot; add tomatoes and tomato <br> paste. Sprinkle with herbs de Provence. Top with water and bouillon.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Step III</h5>
                <p>
                    Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 <br> minutes for pressure to build. Cook for 11 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Step IV</h5>
                <p>
                    Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, <br> about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove lid carefully, turning it away from you. Test chicken for <br> doneness; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). <br>Season the chicken to taste with red pepper flakes and black pepper.
